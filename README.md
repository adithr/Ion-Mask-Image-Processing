# Ion-Mask-Image-Processing

Returns regions-of-interests (ROIs) of an input ion image in grayscale.

To run this notebook, please make sure you have the following python modules installed:
1. Numpy
2. Opencv
3. Python 3.x

The notebook is split into three parts:
1. Helper functions : Auxillary functions to aid the main function
2. Main function (calib_mask_return) : Function which returns masks upon an image input
3. Test cell : Examples of how to use the code

NB:
Possible problems:
    - the code might not work well for very 'zoomed out' images
    - Examples of appropriately zoomed in pictures can be found in the notebook examples
